# Medhamsh’s Readme (Forever In Progress)


This is my first attempt in knowing what a README of a person is and writing one. Hope this gives me an opportunity to you and ME to know about me. 
My whole life revolves around and strives at one thing. How less hypocritical I can be in every little moment of life. 
I see my personal and professional life to be blended in every aspect and not have a gap in between. That way I might not need work-life balance.
The whole inspiration to this came from a friend who said, he chooses to work with people and bosses whom he can invite them to a family party and see that his personal life is not a secret with his professional life. I am trying for this to happen at every stage of my career and make friends everywhere and work with friends not ‘colleagues’.
With this there are great challenges for me as my personal space is too big and blends with my office space a lot and I get tough times satisfying both scenarios.
As the title says, I am forever striving to make everyone happy around. Sometimes good and sometimes bad. But this is the way I have been.
Feedback in my lifestyle is happily accepted and I promise to put in the efforts to change it for a better functionality.

**Get to my immediate notice if I am not Following any of these**

## MY WORK AS A CONTRIBUTOR:

As an independent contributor, I have a weakness. That is to achieve perfection. Until then I won’t even announce what has been done. And I would be working on it continuously improving and then making changes. I am sure the end result would definitely make people happy. This is what I have been witnessing all through the past 13 years in my career. I am putting in efforts to be communicative, descriptive during the process of achieving something.I dont like to be micro-manged. I like to have frequent 1-1 catchups with my managers in order to fail faster than loose all the time.

## MY WORK AS A MANAGER:

* Practice Servant Leadership
* Announce what needs to be done.
* Let anyone choose it to work on and let anyone join them to finish it.
* I don’t want to put any procedures or ways to do it.
* I don’t want it to be done in a specific way.
* I want perfection over faster delivery
* I am okay to explain it over and over until you feel comfortable in understanding it.
* I am not concerned on the desk time you maintain.
* I highly expect you to feel me as a friend and pull me in every discussion apart from work and have fun.

## WHEN DO I GET GRUMPY:
* When you become pessimistic.
* When you say this is not how it has to be done at the end.
* When you haven’t yet started working on it after we have an agreement.

## WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN I AM GRUMPY:
* Initiate a conversation
* Start doing it by involving me.
* Once we are on track, you are good.
* May be do all this over a drink. ;-)

## FEEDBACK:
* Don’t need a formal setup for this.
* As and when needed.
* If we wait for a formal setup it grows into a pile and hard to learn over things.
* Just don’t make me feel like I am an asshole. Because I am willing to learn and change. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule) 

## PREFERRED WAY OF COMMUNICATION:
* Text
* Phone/Video Call
* Slack
* Email
* Communication in a group/channel is even more comfortable.
* As the day ends Text, Phone are lot better. Once I reach home, lot of errands keep falling.

## APPRECIATE ME??
* Prefer in private. 
* Cant handle appreciations well in a group. Bit ambiverted :-)


## OTHER THINGS:
I usually have lot of things on my plate. Feel free to poke me as frequently as possible. Hope to learn a lot from everyone and contribute to a better world even with a miniature contribution.
